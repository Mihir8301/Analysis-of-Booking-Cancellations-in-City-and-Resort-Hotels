Additionally, offer flexible deposit options, such as refundable deposits or staggered payments, to make it more appealing for customers to commit. Clearly communicate the deposit policy during the online booking process, ensuring transparency and trust.

Provide incentives, such as discounts or room upgrades, for guests who are willing to wait for their preferred booking times. This can improve the booking experience and reduce cancellations due to waiting times.
